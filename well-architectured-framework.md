The five pillars are —

1. Operational Excellence 
2. Security
3. Reliability
4. Performance Efficiency
5. Cost Optimization


# Operational Excellence

## Design Priciples

- Perform operations as code
- Annotate documents
- Make frequent, small, reversible changes
- Refine operations procedures frequently
- Anticipate failure
- Learn from all operational failures

## Best Practices

- Prepare
- Operate
- Evolve

# Security

## Design Principles

- Implement a strong identity foundations
- Enable traceability
- Apply security at all layers
- Automate security best practices
- Protect data in transit and at rest
- Keep people away from data
- Prepare for security events

## Best Practices

- Identity and Access Management
- Detective Controls
- Infrastructure Protection
- Data Protection
- Incident Response

__Key AWS Service__ — AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).


# Reliability

## Design Principles

- Test recovery procedures
- Automatically recover from failure
- Scale horizontally to increase aggregate system availability 
- Stop guessing capacity
- Manage change in automation

## Best Practices

- Foundations
- Change Management

# Cost Optimization

## Design Principles

- Adopt a consumption model
- Measure overall efficiency
- Stop spending money on data center operations
- Analyze and attribute expenditure
- Use managed and application level services to reduce cost of ownership

## Best Practices
